## Explanation

The **Titanic** dataset provides a summary of the survival status of passengers and crew aboard the Titanic. The data has 4 factors: passenger class (`Class`), gender (`Sex`), age (`Age`), and whether they survived (`Survived`). This visualization aims to explore the sursvival counts across different passenger classes and genders.

## Load Dataset

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

data("Titanic")
titanic <- as.data.frame(Titanic)
```

## Visualization

```{r}
ggplot(titanic, aes(x = Survived, y = Freq, fill = Survived)) +
  geom_col(alpha = 0.9) +
  facet_grid(Sex ~ Class) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("No" = "red", "Yes" = "lightgreen")) +
  labs(
    title = "Survival on the Titanic by Class and Gender",
    x = "Survival Status",
    y = "Number of People"
  )
```
